                            p  You can open any of the files in your browser to see it in action, or modify their markup or content to suit your needs.
                            p  If you will be using Gulp and HTML combination to help you with your work, these HTML files would be used by Gulp during the development.

                            p With the extensive usage of mixins, includes and layouts, you will avoid repetitive tasks you would need to do if working with HTML source. E.g., if you change the navbar, the change will be applied in all your pages, unlike when developing with HTML, where you would need to do the same change in every file.
